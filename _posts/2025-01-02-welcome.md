## A New Beginning

Welcome! I'm excited to launch this space where I can share my journey of faith, my adventures in aviation, insights from my work in software testing, and my love for music.

### Why This Site?

> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters." — Colossians 3:23

This verse captures my approach to life. Everything I do — whether it's ensuring software quality at GE Aerospace, flying an aircraft, or playing bass guitar — is an opportunity to glorify God and serve others.

### What to Expect

I'll be sharing:
- **Faith reflections** and encouraging devotionals
- **Aviation stories** and lessons learned from the cockpit
- **QA and testing insights** from my 10+ year work experience
- **Music musings** and creative projects

Thanks for stopping by. Let's journey together!

**Grace and peace,**  
Jose
