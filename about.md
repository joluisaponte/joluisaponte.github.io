<!-- # About Jose Luis Aponte -->

## Faith Journey

My faith in Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of my life. I believe that God has given me gifts and opportunities to serve others, and I strive to honor Him in everything I do — whether that's writing code, flying an aircraft, or encouraging someone through music.

> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters." — Colossians 3:23

## Aviation

I'm a licensed pilot who loves the technical precision and freedom that aviation provides. Flying has taught me discipline, situational awareness, and the importance of preparation — skills that translate directly to software engineering. I fly out of I68 with the flying club Flying Neutrons which has Cessna fleet from 172s to a 206. I'll be working on my Instrument and Commercial very soon.

## Music

Bass guitar is my creative expression. I play in worship bands and enjoy the collaborative nature of making music. The rhythm section is all about serving the song, much like quality engineering serves the product.
